- Only have one h1 tag in your page for accessibility purposes

- Using arbitrary percentages (i.e. not 50% or 100%) is bad practice

- calc is a really powerful tool

- use grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit,minmax(150,1fr)); to fit consistently sized elements with an intended minimum width into a grid

- set base font size in pixel units, and have different rem values for different screen size ranges
